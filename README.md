# Automated Resumer Parser

I developed a website that allows applicants to upload their resumes and allows recruiters to search for qualified candidates.

The backend component parses through pdfs and indexes key information for easy search.

## Structure

### resume-uploader:

-- where applicants can upload their resumes

-- setup: `npm install` and `npm start`

### resume-server:

-- where parsing occurs for the dashboard

-- setup: `npm install` and `npm run dev`

### resume-dashboard:

-- where recruiters can input keywords and receive an ordered list of the most qualified candidates

-- setup: `npm install` and `npm start`
